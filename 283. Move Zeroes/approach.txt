0 Naive Approach
    Iterate through elements starting at index 0.
        When the current element is zero,
            Shift all following elements left.
            Set the last element to zero.
    TC = O(N2), SC = O(1)


2 Pointer Approach
    Move all the non zero elements to the front using two pointers,
    remaining elements will automatically be the zeros because we
    use swap.
    TC = O(N), SC = O(N)
