1 Hash Map 1 Array
    Find out which array is shorter.
    Use hash map or Counter to get the frequency of each element
    in the smaller array.
    Iterate through each element in larger array.
    Check that element is in hash map.
    Store matching element in output array.
    Decrement frequency in hash map.

2 Hash Map Comparison
    Hash maps of both lists
    Use built in python intersection comparison of dictionaries
    counter1&counter2.elements()

    TC = O(N), SC = O(N + M), create two dictionaries
