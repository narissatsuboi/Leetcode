Reverse String Approaches
#1 Swap elements of string around midpoint m
 TC = O(N), SC = O(1)

#2 Recursion
#2a Base case: Size of the array is less than 2
Recursive case: Size of array is greater than 2

#2b Base case: left pointer is greater than right pointer
Recursive case: left pointer is still less than right pointer, swap
and update pointers

 TC = O(logN), getting smaller each time
 SC = O(N), recursive stack
